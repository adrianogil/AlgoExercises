# The “Hello, World” program is the first program you learn
# to write in many languages, but it doesn’t involve any input.
# So create a program that prompts for your name and prints a greeting using your name.
# Example Output
#       What is your name? Brian
#       Hello, Brian, nice to meet you!
# Challenge:
# - Write a new version of the program without using any variables.

print(f"Hello, {input('What is your name? ')}, nice to meet you!")
